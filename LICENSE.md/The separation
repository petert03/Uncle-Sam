"Go there,be strong,study good and make us all proud";was yelling my dad at the gate as i was walking to the boarding door. 
Without knowing where i was going or what will happen to me when be on the other side of the world. The sky was dark and all 
stars gonne as we were taking off. The sounds of the plane was breaking my hearing and my stomack start hurting. At this point
i start realizing that i was gonne for good and that i maybe wont my family anymore. Thirty minutes were enough for me to start
missing my family. In africa after you graduate high school,parents start looking for place to send their kids for better 
opportunies. Few months after finishing high school all my friends went away on their own pth to persue their drems,eithe its in
europe,america asia or in the interior of africa. With my eyes closes,deeply thinking about my family and my people,i start feeling
the airplane going down and the flight attendants telling us to put our seatbelts on;we were landing on paris for a six hours
layover. From the windows i could already see outside. I had six hours to visit the aiport,taste europeen food and already i 
was missing my mother delicious food. We got back on the plane for another seven hours in the air and as i was closing my eyes
wihtout getting any sleep,i start getting some souvenir back from my country that i just left few hours ago.
